    "# Reader\nReader is an ebook reader based on pure javascript renderers. It works for publications formatted according to the following standards:\n\n - [Epub]\n - [PDF]\n - [CBR and CBZ] ('comics')\n\nFor Epub Reader uses the futurepress [epub.js] renderer to provide near-native looks, especially when used full-screen. Turn pages by pressing the left/right hand side of the screen/window or using the cursor keys (if you have those), use the sidebar to browse through chapters or bookmarks and add annotations.\n\nPDF is handled by Mozilla's [pdf.js] renderer in combination with a custom reader app to enable side-by-side display, batch search and more. Controls are like those used in the Epub renderer with a few exceptions, e.g. night mode has not been implemented yet.\n\nCBR and CBZ are supported using a custom renderer inspired by [balaclark]'s work. As with Epub, books can be navigated using the keyboard as well as mouse or touch navigation. Reader generates a visual index of all pages, show in the sidebar (thumbnail generation can be disabled for low-memory and/or -speed devices). As CBx files are often of varying quality, a set of image enhancement filters are provided.\n\nSee [README] for more exhaustive information on features and potential misfeatures of this app.\n\n   [epub.js]: https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js\n   [Epub]: http://idpf.org/epub\n   [CBR and CBZ]: https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/CBR_and_CBZ\n   [balaclark]: https://github.com/balaclark/HTML5-Comic-Book-Reader\n   [PDF]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format\n   [pdf.js]: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js\n   [README]: https://github.com/e-alfred/epubreader/blob/master/epubreader/README.md" : "# Reader\nReader is an ebook reader based on pure javascript renderers.
